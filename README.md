# Mintgarden NFT Data Retrieval

This Python script interacts with the Mintgarden API to gather information about specific NFT collections, retrieve their images and associated JSON metadata.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
- Collects NFT metadata (IDs, names, and file names) from the Mintgarden API for a specified collection (in this case, Chamster Golfers Series).
- Retrieves the image and metadata associated with each NFT based on the collected information.

## Usage

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script.

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:
    ```
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Set up the script:
    - Update the collection ID in the script to match the desired collection.
    - Adjust any other parameters or configurations to fit your requirements.

4. Run the script:
    ```
    python mintgarden_nft_retrieval.py
    ```

## Code Structure

The script is divided into two main parts:

1. **NFT Metadata Retrieval**:
    - Fetches metadata (IDs, names, and file names) for NFTs in the specified collection.
    - Collects this data and stores it for subsequent use.

2. **Image and Metadata Retrieval**:
    - Utilizes the collected metadata to fetch the image and JSON metadata files for each NFT.
    - Saves the retrieved files into respective directories (`images` and `metadata`) using the file names collected during metadata retrieval.

## Notes

- Ensure proper network connectivity while running the script to access the Mintgarden API.
- The script's logic assumes the structure and endpoints of the Mintgarden API; modifications may be needed if the API structure changes.
